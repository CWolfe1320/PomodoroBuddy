# Pomodoro Buddy
Pomodoro Buddy is an application which aims to assist in productivity by encouraging "sprints" of work which are then rewarded with short breaks.


# How it works
Pomodoro Buddy follows the pomodoro method when it is set to the default settings. That means you have twenty-five minutes of study time, followed by five minutes of break time.
Every 5 breaks is a longer thirty minute break. When the timer reaches zero on any of the stretches (study, or breaks) it will issue a warning and immediately start counting back to whatever the
last initialized time was. Acknowledging the warning will continue the streak, but if you let the timer reach the last initialized time the streak will be lost. When streaks are
lost via this method, or if the timer is stopped via the "stop" button your current pomodoro streak will be recorded to be used for the highscore tracker, and general stats.
